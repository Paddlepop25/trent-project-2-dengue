## Aim

Because this project is due around the December holiday season, I was reminded of an incident that happened 2 years ago. My husband had taken a week off work for the Christmas week and we had plans to spend precious time together. Instead, he was stricken with dengue fever and he spent the week (and more) lying on the couch. He went to the doctor's every day to have his blood drawn for measuring his white blood cells and platelets count. Needless to say, it wasn't a fun Christmas.

Dengue is prevalent in this part of the world because of rainfall, still-water and humidity. Every year, there are people who are infected with the dengue virus after being bitten by the female Andes mosquito and there had been a few deaths too. The government had many educational campaignes to educate people to lower the risk of potential mosquito breeding ground and how to protect themselves from being bitten.

I wanted to make this website for people who are suffering from dengue as well as for their loved ones. I included useful information about dengue here, the dengue clusters in Singapore, suggested nearby amenities they may need and also links to other sources for further reading.

I hope that this website would benefit those seeking for knowledge about dengue.

## UX

This project is designed starting with a mobile-first approach, with a slight variation on the layout for medium and larger sized screens. I intended this website to be clean looking and simple to use with access to information quickly.

Colors were especially used to achieve this objective. I wanted the website to have a primary pinkish theme color (#fde3e3) to set a soothing and calming tone, and an accompanying secondary color of maroon (rgb(171, 0, 0)) to highlight links for the users to click on. The latter was especially chosen to remind users that getting dengue is via the blood through mosquito bites.

On the hover state for links and buttons, the maroon color would change to a darker maroon tone to indicate that a 'call for action' from the user is possible and recommended.

The white background was utilized to enable users to focus their attention on the texts and buttons and not distract them unnecessarily with looking beyond these important information.

In the large devices' view, I placed the boxes containing important information towards the center of the screen to have the users' eyes level to follow the website smoothly downwards. This was contrasted with a full width map for creating a subtle interesting visual appeal to the users.

I also added a secret 'easter egg' in the form of a small mosquito icon in the footer. When the user hovers over it, it shakes and it makes one feel like slapping it dead. Well, it also points users to the Ministry of Health wesbite. If one didn't manage to spot this, it is okay as the same link is provided in the 'For More Information' section. I deliberately left out the shadow upon hover as when it shakes, it looks just like an Andes mosquito with the stripped black and white legs.

## UI

The navigation bar is responsive for small, medium and large screens following Bootstrap's breakpoints. An animated hamburger icon is available for small and medium screen on the top right corner of the website. A dropdown menu with links to different parts of the website allows the user to navigate there quickly. When the screen is large-sized and above, the navigation bar displays the links on top of the screen instead.

I included a smooth scrolling effect for the links on the navbar so it feels like the users are invited to the desired position on the page rather than feeling like they are dropped there.

Two google [fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?selection.family=Roboto|Rubik&query=rub) were chosen for this website. I used 'Rubik' for the titles on the page and 'Roboto' for the rest of the texts. They were chosen for their rounded features which I wanted to look inviting to the users.

The [landing](https://paddlepop25.github.io/trent-project-2-dengue/) page was designed to give an impactful message right from the start. It teaches the users how to get rid of stagnent water in 5 steps. These are the highest causes of stangnent water in Singapore with high rise buildings all around the country. Each individual needs to be responsible for their environment as this is a small country but with many people per square foot.

Following that, the users are presented with boxes of information separated appropriately. They could choose to go to the place on the website directly by clicking on the [dengue](https://paddlepop25.github.io/trent-project-2-dengue/#dengue-update) link on the navbar. I included the most asked questions one may have if he/she has contracted dengue or their loved ones have. The information is brief, but sufficient as it covers the most important aspects of dengue. There are also links to other sources and these are highlighted with the theme color.

Next is the [dengue cluster](https://paddlepop25.github.io/trent-project-2-dengue/#abovezones) section where one could see where the dengue clusters are in Singapore with a click of a button. Several zones are provided that shows the different parts of Singapore and one can 'reset' the map with click on the 'Singapore' button. This shows the initial map with all the collective clusters in the country.
