## Aim

Because this project is due around the December holiday season, I was reminded of an incident that happened 2 years ago. My husband had taken a week off work for the Christmas week and we had plans to spend precious time together. Instead, he was stricken with dengue fever and he spent the week (and more) lying on the couch. He went to the doctor's every day to have his blood drawn for measuring his white blood cells and platelets count. Needless to say, it wasn't a fun Christmas.

I wanted to make this website for people who are suffering from dengue as well as for their loved ones. I included useful information about dengue here, the dengue clusters in Singapore, suggested nearby amenities they may need and also links to other sources for further reading.

I hope that this website would benefit those seeking for knowledge about dengue.

## UX

This project is designed starting with a mobile-first approach, with a slight variation on the layout for medium and larger sized screens. I intended this website to be clean looking and simple to use with access to information quickly.

Colors were especially used to achieve this objective. I wanted the website to have a primary pinkish theme color (#fde3e3) to set a soothing and calming tone, and an accompanying secondary color of maroon (rgb(171, 0, 0)) to highlight links for the users to click on. The latter was especially chosen to remind users that getting dengue is via the blood through mosquito bites.

On the hover state for links and buttons, the maroon color would change to a darker maroon tone to indicate that a 'call for action' from the user is possible and recommended.

The white background was utilized to enable users to focus their attention on the texts and buttons and not distract them unnecessarily with looking beyond these important information.

In the large devices' view, I placed the boxes containing important information towards the center of the screen to have the users' eyes level to follow the website smoothly downwards. This was contrasted with a full width map for creating a subtle interesting visual appeal to the users.
