## Aim

Because this project is due around the December holiday season, I was reminded of an incident that happened 2 years ago. My husband had taken a week off work for the Christmas week and we had plans to spend precious time together. Instead, he was stricken with dengue fever and he spent the week (and more) lying on the couch. He went to the doctor's every day to have his blood drawn for measuring his white blood cells and platelets count. Needless to say, it wasn't a fun Christmas.

I wanted to make this website for people who are suffering from dengue as well as for their loved ones. I included useful information about dengue here, the dengue clusters in Singapore, suggested nearby amenities they may need and also links to other sources for further reading.

I hope that this website would benefit those seeking for knowledge about dengue.
